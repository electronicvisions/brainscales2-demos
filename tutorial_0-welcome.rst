Welcome to the BrainScaleS-2 Tutorial
=====================================

Hello and welcome to this tutorial that will interactively guide you through your first experiments on the BrainScaleS-2 system!

You will learn the basic tools for running experiments on the BrainScaleS-2 platform.

In this session, we will cover the following topics:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tutorial_1-single_neuron
   tutorial_2-superspike
   tutorial_3-hagen_intro
   tutorial_6-multicompartment

In this section of the tutorial, we will go through the technical details and make sure that you are correctly set up for accessing our hardware resources.


Executing the Notebooks
-----------------------
If you want to execute the notebooks yourself, you can clone them from our
`github repository <https://github.com/electronicvisions/brainscales2-demos/tree/jupyter-notebooks>`_ and
execute them on the `EBRAINS Platform <https://wiki.ebrains.eu>`_.
Simply use an existing collabatory or create a new one in which you can clone the notebooks, e.g., via:

.. code-block:: bash

   !git clone https://github.com/electronicvisions/brainscales2-demos.git --branch jupyter-notebooks

in a notebook of your JupyterLab session.

Make sure to start the kernel named ``EBRAINS_release_...`` by either selecting the E symbol or by choosing the kernel from the list of available kernels when asked to.

Shared Hardware Resources
--------------------------
We utilize the intrinsic speed of the system to offer you an interactive experience that is as smooth as possible even though multiple participants will access the same chip at any given point in time.

This process is hidden by a custom microscheduler (*quiggeldy*), a conceptual view of which you can see in the following figure.
The actual hardware execution time has been colored in blue.

Please note that the hardware performance you will experience is affected by other users in this tutorial and can not be perceived as an accurate representation of the expected performance for single-user workloads.

For the microscheduler to work we have to set some environment variables:

.. include:: common_quiggeldy_setup.rst

Final test: Hardware Execution
------------------------------
Before we start with the actual tutorial, we'd like to ensure that you are correctly set up for running experiments on the BrainScaleS-2 platform.
To do so, simply run the following minimal PyNN-experiment.
It should terminate without errors.

.. code-block:: python3

    import pynn_brainscales.brainscales2 as pynn

    pynn.setup()
    neurons_1 = pynn.Population(2, pynn.cells.HXNeuron())
    neurons_2 = pynn.Population(3, pynn.cells.HXNeuron())
    pynn.Projection(neurons_1, neurons_2, pynn.AllToAllConnector())
    pynn.run(0.2)
    pynn.end()
