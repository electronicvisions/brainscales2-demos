    "The analog network core consists of a synapse matrix (green dots), a row\n",
    "of neurons (circles on bottom), and a column of synapse drivers\n",
    "(triangles on the left). The synapse drivers stimulate twin-rows of\n",
    "synapses for a variable time. By combining an excitatory and inhibitory\n",
    "synapse, we can allow for signed values in the weight matrix. The\n",
    "synapses send their charge output to the neurons at the bottom, which\n",
    "integrate the currents on the membrane. A columnar analog-to-digital\n",
    "converter (CADC) can digitize the membrane potentials of all neurons in\n",
    "parallel. The on-chip processor (PPU) will then read the result vector\n",
    "obtained by the CADC and could perform further operations with it.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example MAC operation, a vector (31, 5) is to be multiplied with\n",
    "a column of weights (20, -63).\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the first vector entry, the top synapse driver activates the\n",
    "top twin-row of synapses for a long time as the vector value is 31 (=\n",
    "maximum of our 5-bit range). The positively signed synapse creates a low\n",
    "current as the weight is 20 (maximum would be 63 in our 6-bit range).\n",
    "The neuron receives a long but small current input and the membrane\n",
    "voltage rises.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next vector entry, the second synapse driver enables the\n",
    "synapses much shorter as the vector value is only 5. The current\n",
    "generated by the synapse is higher as its weight is maximum. The neuron\n",
    "receives a short but strong current input, but subtracts it from the\n",
    "membrane voltage as the synapse attaches to its inhibitory input."
