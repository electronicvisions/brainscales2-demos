    "\n",
    "To start, we create a small network with a single spiking leak-integrate and fire (LIF) `Neuron`, receiving inputs through a linear `Synapse` layer.\n",
    "Network layers in `hxtorch` are derived from a parent class `HXModule` (similar to `torch.nn.Module` in PyTorch), requiring an instance of `Experiment` which keeps track of all network layers to be run within the same experiment on BSS-2.\n",
    "While `Neuron`s can be parameterized individually, we keep the default parameters for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we create some input spikes and emulate the network.\n",
    "The membrane potential of the LIF is measured using the columnar ADC (CADC) and the membrane (MADC).\n",
    "While the first allows sampling all neuron potentials on the chip in parallel, the latter can only sample two neurons at the benefit of having a higher temporal resolution.\n",
    "The units are CADC / MADC Values, which in principle are translatable to mV (which will be implemented in the future).\n",
    "When modules are called to infere the networks topology, they return `Handles` (e.g. `g`, `z`) which act as promises to future hardware data which get filled after the hardware experiment is run.\n",
    "Note that in `hxtorch` the returned hardware data is mapped to a dense time grid of shape `(batch_size, time_steps, population_size)` of resolution `dt`."
