Solving sudokus with BrainScaleS-2
==================================

In this task we want to apply our newly gained knowledge to a well-known problem:
We will deal with solving a sudoku on spiking hardware.

If you never before encountered this logic puzzle from 1984, let's define the rules.
Usually you have a 9x9 square grid and the goal is to fill in numbers from 1 to 9, given crucial constraints:

1. In each row, each number is only allowed exactly once.
2. In each column, each number is only allowed exactly once.
3. In each 3x3 sub grid, each number is only allowed exactly once.

To find a valid solution, hints are given in form of given, fixed numbers.
An obvious strategy for solving a sudoku is to, sequentially, find a square where only one number is allowed.
This seems trivial but due to the high dimensionality finding a solution is a non-trivial task.
However, checking the correctness of a potential solution is a simple task.
To circumvent the slowness of a brute-force solution one can resort to a stochastic strategy.
In fact, a spiking neuronal network (SNN) can accomplish this task in this manner quickly and with high precision.

The basic idea in creating a sudoku solver with an SNN is to assign to each possible number in each field one neuron, called one-hot encoding.
In our case, each field would have four neurons representing the numbers 1 to 4, respectively.
A neuron being active is interpreted as that field being filled with the respective number, consequently a given, hinted number is represented by a continuously spiking neuron.
An excluding constraint will be realised with an inhibitory synapse due to the suppressing effect on the activity.
To allow the network to explore different states, a random Poisson-distributed background noise is applied to all neurons.
In addition, each neuron is excitatorily connected to itself to maintain possible activity.


Let's start with a simplified version of a sudoku with a 4x4 grid, as shown in the figure.
Assume the grey three is given, applying the previously mentioned constraints we obtain:

* Due to 1, the purple threes are not allowed.
* Due to 2, the green threes are not allowed.
* Due to 3, the blue threes are not allowed.
* Due to the choice of our encoding, the orange numbers are not allowed (in each field only one number is allowed to be active)

    Representation of a 4x4 sudoku with one-hot encoding:
    In each small square, each number from 1 to 4 has one respective neuron;
    four small squares, framed by the thick line, make one block in the original sudoku;
    there are four such blocks to complete the 4x4 sudoku.

The hardware will try to solve the given sudoku.
If you want to implement your own sudoku with unknown numbers you can enter `0` as an empty field.
(*Hint*: When you change the sudoku, rerun the cell)

The hints are chosen randomly. By varying the seed you vary the position of the clue and by changing the number the sudoku changes the difficulty.

Exercises
---------

- **Task 1:**
  Run the network without any constrains, observe the spike pattern and the solution of the sudoku.
  Try to explain.

.. only:: Solution

    **The sudoku is not solved correctly.
    In the spike pattern one can observe the neurons that are related to the clues due to their regular spiking.
    All other neurons are on their own and therefore the resulting numbers depend on calibration and thermodynamics.
    The numbers in the fields are related to the neurons, that spiked the most in the runtime.**

- **Task 2:**
  Now implement the four constrains rules discussed above.
  If they are correctly implemented you should get a solved sudoku (keep number of hints and seed).

Now you have a working sudoku solver. Let's test it:

- **Task 3:**
  Vary the number of clues.
  If the solver fails can you find an explanation for that behavior?
  Can you think of possible strategies to reduce such errors?
  (*It might help to inspect the code and numpy documentation*)

.. only:: Solution

    **In some cases (especially in when the number of clues decreases) the solver can fail
    If one closely observes the firing pattern, it looks like the solver converged to the right number (right neuron was firing last) but due to the implementation of winning strategy in `get_solution()`, the wrong number is chosen.
    The winning strategy in this case is given by**

    .. code:: ipython3

        # num_spikes = [
        #     len(num_population.get_data("spikes").segments[-1].spiketrains[0])
        #     for num_population in field_populations
        # ]
        # grid[row, col] = np.argmax(num_spikes) + 1

    **and therefore the neuron is chosen who fired most in runtime.
    Possible solutions to tackle this problem are:**
    - **Extend the runtime**
    - **Look at last spike (not quite reliable)**
    - **Examine only a fraction of the runtime near the end and count the spikes within this period**

- **Task 4:**
  What do you expect to happen, if you set the number of clues to zero?
  Check your hypothesis.
  Can you explain your observation?

.. only:: Solution

    **The sudoku is solved correctly (most of the time?)
    Random noise and thermodynamics choose some neurons and their numbers are fixed. From that all other related neurons are inhibited.
    That's why a valid solution is generated.
    It might be, that the solution doesn't change. This is hardware related (although the calibration should take care of it)**

- **Task 5:**
  Now, investigate how the success rate is related to the number of clues.
  For this, vary the number of clues from four to ten.
  Repeat each configuration ten times, while keeping the sudoku fixed.
  Visualize your result.

- **Task 6:**
  Is there a constraint that is not necessarily required?
  Why?

.. only:: Solution

    **Actually this is a good question, have to investigate (1 or 4 or both (more likely the latter))**

- **Task 7:**
  Crunching some numbers:
  How many neurons and how many synaptic connections were required in this task?
  How many would be required for a 9x9 sudoku?

.. only:: Solution

    **4x4**
    - **Number of Neurons = 4^3 = 64**
    - **Number of Synapses = 1 self + 1 BG + 1 Clue + 3 ownField + 3 row + 3 column + localSquare = 13 (24 if outgoing connections are counted as well)**

    **9x9**
    - **Number of Neurons = 9^3 = 729**
    - **Number of Synapses = 73 (144)**
