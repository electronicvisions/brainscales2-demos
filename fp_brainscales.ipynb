    "BrainScaleS-2 is a spiking, accelerated mixed-signal neuromorphic platform:\n",
    "It captures the dynamics of neurons and synapses in mostly analog integrated circuits and augments this physical emulation of the underlying differential equations by digital periphery.\n",
    "The analog circuits exploit the native scale of capacitances and conductances to accelerate the neural dynamics by a factor of 1000.\n",
    "Typical time constants of multiple milliseconds are therefore rendered at the scale of microseconds, the cybernetic interaction between actors and their simulated environment then take place on the order of milliseconds <sup>[1](#wunderlich2019demonstrating)</sup> <sup>[2](#schreiber2021accelerated)</sup>, and learning can e.g. occur on the scale of seconds <sup>[1](#wunderlich2019demonstrating)</sup> <sup>[3](#billaudelle2021structural)</sup>.\n",
    "This acceleration also relies on the sheer parallelism and asynchronicity of the individual neurons and synapses the neuromorphic system inherits from its archetype, the nervous system.\n",
    "The speed-up is relevant for applications in the two fields of machine intelligence and brain modelling which BrainScaleS-2 aims to cover both.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The BrainScaleS-2 ASIC is centered around an analog neuromorphic core housing the circuits emulating the neuronal and synaptic dynamics.\n",
    "This conglomerate of mostly analog full-custom circuits evolves in continuous time, asynchronously to its periphery.\n",
    "These dynamics can be configured and tuned through local SRAM exposed to the outside via individual memory controllers.\n",
    "The synapse matrices, basically representing large in-memory compute arrays, are a prime example of this architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASIC is optimized for event-based communication and to that end provides an on-chip spike router.\n",
    "Spikes can be directly injected into the ASIC from the “outside”, e.g. a host computer or – in a multi-chip system – other ASIC or potentially a sensor circuit.\n",
    "In these cases, the events are relayed by an FPGA acting as a real-time communication interface.\n",
    "For that purpose, the high-speed communication links provide dedicated event packages optimized for low latency and featuring a timed release mechanism.\n",
    "In addition, background spike sources are directly provided on the ASIC itself <sup>[8](#schemmel2020accelerated)</sup>.\n",
    "They can be configured to emit regular or Poisson spike trains at a total bandwidth of 8 × 125 MEvent/s.\n",
    "Finally, events can also be triggered via the on-chip configuration bus.\n",
    "This can be used for debugging purposes or to directly inject stimuli from the custom embedded processors.\n",
    "Events from all of these sources are merged together in an event routing module and then forwarded to the analog neuromorphic core, output spikes originating from the neuron circuits can travel in the opposite direction.\n",
    "In both cases, the respective source of a spike is encoded in a 14 bit event label <sup>[9](#karasenko2020neumann)</sup>.\n",

    "## The analog neuromorphic core\n",
    "\n",
    "The analog core is segmented into multiple specialized subsystems for both the neuromorphic emulation itself and supporting roles.\n",
    "While generally following the logical arrangement shown in the block-level overview, it’s layout exploits multiple symmetries:\n",
    "Most analog circuits are grouped in four quadrants, mainly to reduce adverse effects such as parasitic capacitances and propagation delays caused by otherwise excessively long metal routing.\n",
    "The circuits within a quadrant also share a common block of analog parameter storage cells and thus a common reference current.\n",
    "This symmetry is, however, broken by the logical organization of the synapse arrays, which rather propose a vertical symmetry.\n",
    "The two resulting halves are, however, not completely independent, as the event readout of the neuron backend logic is partially shared between the upper and the lower neuron arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following paragraphs discuss the individual circuits one by one and in that process roughly follow the path of an event from the presynaptic synapse drivers to a neuron’s membrane."

    "### Synapse drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the synapse driver circuits <sup>[10](#billaudelle2017design)</sup> is to accept events from the on-chip event router and to inject them into the synapse array.\n",
    "In that process, they generate the control signals required by the synapses and ensure their correct timing.\n",
    "These, most importantly, encompass an enable signal (`dacen`) of typically 4 ns to gate the current emitted by the synapse DACs.\n",
    "Furthermore, the synapse drivers provide the 6 bit event address (`address[5:0]`), a corresponding enable signal (`adren`), and the “sign” of the whole row of synapses.\n",
    "The synapse drivers are able to process events with a separation of 8 ns and can thus handle up to 125 Event/s.\n",
    "Each synapse driver interfaces two rows of synapses, trading symmetry for a more area-efficient implementation.\n",
    "On a full-size BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, both synapse arrays respectively host 256 rows and thus feature 128 synapse driver instances.\n",
    "Each driver listens to one of four event interfaces and can be individually addressed via a 5 bit row select mask, corresponding to bits 6 to 10 of the event packages.\n",
    "More detailed information on the interface and the addressing scheme are provided in the original circuit description <sup>[10](#billaudelle2017design)</sup>."

    "\n",
    "Their primary function is to convert afferent events into analog current pulses and for that purpose they each employ a 6 bit DAC.\n",
    "The magnitude of the synaptic current is scaled by the respective weight value, $ w $, which is locally stored in 6 bit of full-custom SRAM.\n",
    "The rather short pulse widths of 0 to 4 ns, correspondingly modulated by the synapse driver circuits, appear instantaneous when compared to the time scales of the emulated neural dynamics, which typically take place on orders of few to dozens of microseconds.\n",

    "The synapses of a row do not necessarily have to share the same source.\n",
    "Instead, each synapse can individually attach to one of up to 64 different presynaptic partners.\n",
    "For that purpose, they each store a 6 bit source address in their local SRAM alongside their weight.\n",
