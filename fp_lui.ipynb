    "To get accustomed to the concept of neuromorphic computation, you will work with *Lu.i*.\n",
    "Lu.i is an electronic neuron circuit mimicking and illustrating the basic dynamics of real, biological neurons.\n",
    "The printed circuit board (PCB) features a configurable, fully analog implementation of the leaky integrate-and-fire model and visualizes the internal state, the membrane potential, through a VU-meter-style chain of LEDs.\n",
    "The neuron emits a short pulse whenever the membrane potential crosses a predefined threshold voltage.\n",
    "Neurons communicate by exchanging these spikes because multiple boards can be connected via jumper wires to form networks.\n",
