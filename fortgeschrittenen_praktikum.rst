Hello and welcome to this lab course!
You will learn about BrainScaleS-2, a neuromorphic platform developed in Heidelberg, and gain hands-on experience with the tools required to conduct experiments on this platform.
For that, we will familiarize you with concepts in neuromorphic computing and how they originated from neuroscience.
We start with an overview of the biological behavior of neurons and synapses and present models from literature that are useful in neuromorphic computing.
We then introduce the BrainScaleS-2 system and the software module used to interface with it.
In the experiment part, you will first investigate the behavior of silicon neurons using Lu.i, an analog electronic implementation of a simple neuron model.
Following this, you will learn how to set up and run experiments on BrainScaleS-2 and apply your knowledge in configuring a feedforward network and solving sudoku using neural networks.
We invite you to read the following material before you start the lab course.

    There are further experiments that are not part of the usual course, but can be both very instructive and helpful in case you want to do a long/short report.
    These experiments include working on the calibration, studying the synaptic input, dealing with more complex neuron models, and training neural networks.
    If you are interested, you can have a look online at the `Electronic Visions github page <https://github.com/electronicvisions/brainscales2-demos/tree/jupyter-notebooks>`_.
