    "\n",
    "The major building blocks of the nervous system are neurons.\n",
    "Neurons come in a variety of morphologies or anatomical structures, but the basic structure can be described as consisting of three major parts which serve different functions.\n",
    "The cell body of the neuron is called the soma, which is the central processing unit of the neuron.\n",
    "The dendrites are extensions from the soma that carry input signals to the neuron.\n",
    "The axon is also an extension from the soma that carries output signals to other neurons.\n",
    "Neurons are connected through synapses, where transmission of signals takes place from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron.\n",
    "Most synapses are chemical, in which signalling molecules called neurotransmitters are released by the presynaptic neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrical signal of interest in the nervous system is the difference in the electrical potential between the interior of the neuron and the exterior of the neuron, referred to as the membrane potential.\n",
    "This physical quantity is used to describe the state of a single neuron and the communication between neurons.\n",
    "Originally, a presynaptic neuron receives inputs from synapses through the neurotransmitters.\n",
    "These neurotransmitters can alter the membrane potential of the neuron either by increasing the potential (excitatory) or decreasing the potential (inhibitory).\n",
    "Depending on the type and strength of the inputs, the membrane potential exceeds a threshold, and the neuron generates a signal.\n",
    "This signal is referred to as an “action potential” or a “spike”.\n",
    "A spike travels along the axon of the presynaptic neuron until it reaches the axon terminals where neurotransmitters are released to different synapses.\n",
    "These neurotransmitters initiate specific biophysical mechanisms that induce postsynaptic currents in the postsynaptic neurons.\n",
    "The postsynaptic currents can thus alter the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neurons.\n",
    "The resulting signals influencing the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neurons are referred to as postsynaptic potentials."

    "## Mathematical Formulation of Neuronal Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in mathematically formulating the state of a single neuron and the communication between neurons.\n",
    "For that, let’s have a closer look at the physical behavior of a neuron, especially at the membrane potential of the soma.\n",
    "In the absence of any stimulation, we observe a negative resting membrane potential of approximately $ -65 $ mV, a strongly negative polarized state.\n",
    "A stimulation happening through the dendrites changes the membrane potential.\n",
    "This can be formalized as follows:\n",
    "At a given time $ t $ the membrane potential of neuron $ i $ is $ u_i(t) $.\n",
    "When the neuron is not stimulated, for all times smaller than $ 0 $, the potential is $ u_i(t<0) = u_\\text{rest} $.\n",
    "At $ t=0 $, a stimulation is triggered by a presynaptic neuron $ j $.\n",
    "We define the postsynaptic potential (PSP) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ij}(t) := u_i(t) - u_\\text{rest}.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",

    "\\epsilon_{ij} = u_i(t) - u_\\text{rest}\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    ">0 & \\quad \\text{excitatory PSP} \\\\\n",
    "<0 & \\quad \\text{inhibitory PSP}.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the membrane potential $ u_i(t) $ does not stay at the same level.\n",
    "In the absence of a stimulation, it decays to the resting potential $ u_\\text{rest} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s assume there are 2 presynaptic neurons $ j=1,2 $ to the postsynaptic neuron $ i $.\n",
    "The presynaptic neurons stimulate the postsynaptic neuron, and PSPs are induced in the postsynaptic neuron at respective times $ t_j^{(m)} $, where $ m $ states the $ m $-th signal peak coming from the $ j $-th neuron.\n",
    "At each incoming signal peak, charges are deposited at the membrane and the potential rises.\n",
    "If many excitatory inputs arrive at neuron $ i $, the membrane potential $ u_i $ can reach a critical value, triggering the neuron to fire.\n",
    "A sharp rise of the membrane potential (reaching a voltage of about $ +100 mV $) is observed, and the potential rise propagates down the axon.\n",
    "The pulse is referred to as a “spike” and the neuron is said to have “spiked”.\n",
    "\n",
    "After such a pulse, the membrane potential drops below the resting potential, and later it returns to the resting state.\n",
    "This final phase is called hyperpolarization or spike-afterpotential.\n",
    "During the hyperpolarization, the neuron can hardly be stimulated.\n",
    "The trajectory of such an event can be observed in following image.\n",

    "On the x-axis is the time while on the y-axis is the membrane potential.\n",
    "At given times $ t_i^{(n)} $ the $ n\\text{th} $ spike from neuron $ i $ arrives at our observed neuron.\n",
    "Each spike leads to a rise of the membrane potential $ u $.\n",
    "The dotted line indicates the assumed path if there hasn’t been a change in current.\n",
    "At the instance $ t_2^{(2)} $, stimulation from incoming spikes is enough for $ u $ to cross $ \\vartheta $ (threshold), and the neuron by itself fires.\n",
    "In case the threshold is not reached, i.e., when only a few presynaptic spikes occur, the membrane potential behaves as the sum of the individual PSPs:\n",

    "Second, the membrane potential processes the information.\n",

    "When this value is crossed from below, an additional circuit emits a voltage spike that propagates to all connected neurons.\n",
