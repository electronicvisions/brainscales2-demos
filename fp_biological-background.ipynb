    "### Neurons in biology\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron can be separated into three major parts which serve different purposes:\n",
    "The central unit of the cell is called soma, that receives ‘input’ from the dendritic tree, basically branched out wires extending around the soma.\n",
    "The ‘input’ arrives at synapses in the form of (chemical) neurotransmitters that are released following activity of a presynaptic neuron.\n",
    "The activity arrives in the form of so-called action potentials or spikes, (electrical) signals that are emitted at a soma and travel through the third part of a neuron, the axon.\n",
    "The neurotransmitters lead to voltage differences at the dendrites, again an electrical signal, which in turn affect the soma that can send out spikes via its axon when a sufficient amount of input has accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at the physical behavior of a cell, especially the membrane potential of the soma.\n",
    "In the absence of any stimulation, we observe a negative resting voltage of approximately $ -65 $ mV, a strongly negative polarized state.\n",
    "A stimulation happening through the dendrites changes the membrane potential.\n",
    "This can be formalized as follows:\n",
    "At a given time $ t $ the membrane potential of neuron $ i $ is $ u_i(t) $.\n",
    "When the neuron is not stimulated, for all times smaller $ 0 $, the potential is $ u_i(t<0) = u_\\text{rest} $.\n",
    "At $ t=0 $ a stimulation occurs in form of a spike  which is triggered by a presynaptic cell.\n",
    "We define\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ij}(t) := u_i(t) - u_\\text{rest}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as the postsynaptic potential (PSP).\n",
    "To indicate the direction of change we define further\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ij} = u_i(t) - u_\\text{rest}\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",

    "<0 & \\quad \\text{inhibitory PSP}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the potential of the membrane does not stay at the same level, it decays towards the resting potential $ u_\\text{rest} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s assume there are 2 presynaptic neurons $ j=1,2 $.\n",
    "These neurons emit signals at respective times $ t_j^{(m)} $ where $ m $ states the $ m $-th signal peak coming from that neuron.\n",
    "At each incoming signal peak, charges are deposited at the membrane and the potential rises.\n",
    "When many excitatory inputs have arrived at the neuron, the membrane potential can reach a critical value, triggering the neuron to fire.\n",
    "A sharp rise of the membrane potential (reaching a voltage of about $ +100 mV $) is observed and the potential propagates down the axon.\n",
    "The neuron is said to have ‘spiked’ and the pulse is referred to as a spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "After such a pulse, the membrane potential drops below the resting voltage and later it returns back.\n",
    "This is called hyperpolarization or spike-afterpotential.\n",
    "In that time the neuron can’t be stimulated.\n",
    "The trajectory of such an event can be observed in following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_static/fp/fp_introduction_psp_staking.png\" style=\"width:40%;\" align=\"center\">\n",

    "On the x axis is the time while on the y axis is the membrane potential.\n",
    "At given times $ t_i^{(n)} $ the $ n\\text{th} $ spike from neuron $ i $ arrives at our observed neuron.\n",
    "Each spike leads to a rise of the membrane potential $ u $.\n",
    "The dotted line indicates the assumed path if there wouldn’t be a change in current.\n",
    "In this instance $ t_2^{(2)} $ is enough to cross $ \\vartheta $ (threshold) and the neuron by itself fires.\n",
    "In the case where the threshold is not reached, i.e., when only a few, weak spikes appear, the voltage behaves as the sum of the individual PSPs:\n",

    "\n",
    "The neuron is driven by biochemical and bioelectrical principles, involving various interactions (for a short overview see [Purves (2009)](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuroscience)).\n",
    "We aim to find a suitable model that describes the basic behavior of neurons without necessarily incorporating all biological aspects.\n",
    "The goal is to obtain a somewhat similar behavior as described in the previous section.\n",
    "The following constraints are applied:\n",
    "The spikes always have to have the same shape, i.e., the shape does not contain any information.\n",
    "Instead, all information will be coded in the timings of the spikes.\n",
    "Further, membrane potential processes the information.\n",
    "Another feature, that needs to be modelled is when $ u_i(t) $ reaches a critical voltage threshold $ \\vartheta $, a spike has to be initialized, causing this neuron “to fire” at this time $ t_i^{(m)} $.\n",
    "Such a model was proposed by [Lapique (1907)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-007-0189-6) and is called leaky fire-and-integrate (LIF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a cell membrane acts as a good insulator.\n",
    "When a current $ I(t) $ arrives at the membrane, additional charge is deposited.\n",
    "This behavior is similar to a capacitor and therefore we abstract a cell membrane by it with a certain capacitance $ C $.\n",
    "As previously discussed, the membrane potential decreases over time; therefore, the charge leaks.\n",
    "This can be emulated with a resistance $ R $.\n",
    "In addition we require a source to define a resting potential.\n",

    "$ I(t) $ in this equation represents a time dependent current flow onto (excitatory) or away from (inhibitory) the membrane.\n",
    "In neuroscience this equation, which describes a leaky integrator, is the equation of a passive neuron.\n",
    "Currently, it fulfills the requirement of integrating incoming spikes (see equation [(1)](#equation-eq-psp-stacking)), but it lacks an active part in the form of a spiking mechanism.\n",
    "For the basic model, we define a threshold value $ \\vartheta $.\n",
    "When this value is crossed from below, an additional circuit emits a voltage spike that propagates to all connected neurons.\n",
    "At the same time, the potential of the capacitance is clamped to a defined value $ u_\\text{reset} $ and kept at this level for the *refractory period* $ \\tau_\\text{r} $."
