BrainScaleS-2 on-chip plasticity experiment
===========================================

In addition to the analog neural network core, BrainScaleS-2 features two embedded
general-purpose processors, called PPUs (Plasticity Processing Units).
They can be used for experiment control and alterations of configuration during
the run-time of an experiment.
This example makes use of this feature by show-casing synaptic plasticity.

.. code:: ipython3

    %matplotlib inline
    from os.path import join
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pynn_brainscales.brainscales2 as pynn
    from dlens_vx_v2 import hal, lola, halco, sta

We want to show how the PPUs can be used to rate-code an image in the activity of
neurons (our canvas will be the activity of the neurons over time).
This is done by switching synapses on and off using a predefined data sequence.
Each PPU has 16kiB on-chip memory. For a quadratic image to fit, it is therefore
limited to 64x64 pixels. For simplicity, only one of the two PPUs is used.

For loading and converting an image, some helpers are required:

.. code:: ipython3

    def read_image(path: str) -> np.array:
        """
        Read image from file and scale it to the weight range.
        :param path: Path to image file
        :return: Image data as numpy array normalised to hardware weight range
        """
        image = np.asarray(plt.imread(path))
        # Scale to weight range [0, 63)
        image = image / image.max() * hal.SynapseWeightQuad.Value.max
        return image

    def image_to_memory_block(image: np.array) -> hal.PPUMemoryBlock:
        """
        Convert image to memory region.

        :param image: Image data to convert.
        :return: Converted image data
        """
        image_h = 64
        image_w = 64

        if (image.shape != (image_h, image_w)):
            raise RuntimeError("Image shape is required to be {}x{} pixels."
                               .format(image_h, image_w))

        # A word in memory is four bytes
        bytes_in_word = 4
        bits_in_byte = 8

        # create memory block
        image_config = hal.PPUMemoryBlock(
            halco.PPUMemoryBlockSize(image_h * image_w // bytes_in_word))

        # construct words by placing bytes
        # in addition, we flip the order of pixels to get a upwards-facing image
        # when plotting the time on the x-axis
        words = image_config.words
        for i in range(image_config.size()):
            for j in range(bytes_in_word):
                index = i * bytes_in_word + j
                image_value = int(image[image_h - 1 - (index % image_h)][
                    index // image_w]) << ((bytes_in_word - 1 - j) * bits_in_byte)
                words[i] = hal.PPUMemoryWord(
                    hal.PPUMemoryWord.Value(int(words[i].value) | image_value))
        image_config.words = words

        return image_config

Controlling the on-chip plasticity processor
--------------------------------------------

Later, we will define the network topology using the pyNN interface.
Loading the PPU program onto the chip and starting the PPU will be injected
as a black-box sequence of instructions:

.. code:: ipython3

    def load_and_start_plasticity_kernel(
            binary_path: str,
            ppu: halco.PPUOnDLS,
            image: np.array,
            wait_duration: int) -> sta.PlaybackProgramBuilder:
        """
        Load the plasticity kernel and trigger its execution.

        :param binary_path: Path to the unstripped (*.bin) program to be loaded
        :param ppu: PPU the program is started on.
        :param image: Image data.
        :param wait_duration: Wait duration between weight changes.
        :return: PlaybackProgramBuilder with instructions for loading a
                 plasticity kernel and triggering its execution.
        """
        builder = sta.PlaybackProgramBuilder()

        ppu_control_reg_run = hal.PPUControlRegister()
        ppu_control_reg_run.inhibit_reset = True

        ppu_control_reg_reset = hal.PPUControlRegister()
        ppu_control_reg_reset.inhibit_reset = False

        program_file = lola.PPUElfFile(binary_path)
        program = program_file.read_program()
        program_on_ppu = halco.PPUMemoryBlockOnPPU(
            halco.PPUMemoryWordOnPPU(0),
            halco.PPUMemoryWordOnPPU(program.size() - 1)
        )

        program_on_dls = halco.PPUMemoryBlockOnDLS(program_on_ppu, ppu)

        # Ensure PPU is in reset state
        builder.write(ppu.toPPUControlRegisterOnDLS(), ppu_control_reg_reset)

        symbols = program_file.read_symbols()

        # Manually initialize memory where symbols will lie, issue #3477
        for _name, symbol in symbols.items():
            value = hal.PPUMemoryBlock(symbol.coordinate.toPPUMemoryBlockSize())
            symbol_on_dls = halco.PPUMemoryBlockOnDLS(symbol.coordinate, ppu)
            builder.write(symbol_on_dls, value)

        # Write image data
        image_symbol = symbols["image"]
        image_config = image_to_memory_block(image)
        image_symbol_on_dls = \
            halco.PPUMemoryBlockOnDLS(image_symbol.coordinate, ppu)
        builder.write(image_symbol_on_dls, image_config)

        # Write wait duration
        wait_duration_symbol = symbols["wait_duration"]
        wait_duration_config = \
            hal.PPUMemoryWord(hal.PPUMemoryWord.Value(wait_duration))
        wait_duration_symbol_on_dls = \
            halco.PPUMemoryWordOnDLS(wait_duration_symbol.coordinate.toMin(), ppu)
        builder.write(wait_duration_symbol_on_dls, wait_duration_config)

        # Write PPU program
        builder.write(program_on_dls, program)

        # Set PPU to run state, start execution
        builder.write(ppu.toPPUControlRegisterOnDLS(), ppu_control_reg_run)

        # Block until writes completed
        builder.block_until(halco.BarrierOnFPGA(), hal.Barrier.omnibus)

        return builder

For our experiment, we first load an image to be rate-encoded later.

.. image:: _static/visions.png
   :width: 10%
   :align: center

.. code:: ipython3

    # Read image into 2d numpy array
    image = read_image(join("_static", "visions.png"))

Furthermore, we set some environment variables for our microscheduler:

.. include:: quiggeldy_setup.rst

Next, the instructions for loading and starting the PPU program and transferring
the original image data are generated.

.. code:: ipython3

    builder = load_and_start_plasticity_kernel(
        "_static/plasticity_kernel.bin",
        halco.PPUOnDLS.top,
        image,
        1000 * 250) # 1 ms

The plasticity kernel
---------------------

We use a pre-compiled program with the following underlying source code.
The image data is transferred into a global object ``image``.
Within the entry-point ``start()``, the program writes synapse weight values
row-wise via ``set_row_via_vector(weight_row, row, dls_weight_base)``.
After each write, a predefined constant time ``wait_duration`` is waited before
the next row of the image is written.
Over time, this leads to each row of the image being present and imprinting itself
onto the neurons' firing rate.

.. literalinclude:: plasticity_kernel.cpp
	:language: cpp

We inject the PPU start directly before the real-time execution in order to
align starting the PPU with the experiment start.

.. code:: ipython3

    injections = pynn.InjectedConfiguration()
    injections.pre_realtime = builder

The experiment
--------------

For this simple binary on-off plasticity, we don't need the full-fledged capabilities
of the neurons and therefore configure them to bypass-mode, where every incoming spike
elicits an output spike.

.. code:: ipython3

    pynn.setup(enable_neuron_bypass=True, injected_config=injections)

Our network uses a single-layer feed-forward structure.
External Poisson stimulus is generated with a constant rate.
We use multiple sources for decorrelation of the neurons' spikes in order to prevent
congestion effects due to the neuron bypass mode.

.. code:: ipython3

    bg_props = dict(
        start=0,  # ms
        rate=4000,  # Hz
        duration=64  # ms
    )
    external_input = pynn.Population(64, pynn.cells.SpikeSourcePoisson(**bg_props))

The target population consists of 64 neurons, spikes are recorded.

.. code:: ipython3

    neurons = pynn.Population(64, pynn.cells.HXNeuron())
    neurons.record(["spikes"])

Since the external stimulus population's size matches the internal population's size,
a on-to-one connector is used as projection.
Initially the weight is set to zero, the PPU will alter it during the experiment.

.. code:: ipython3

    synapse = pynn.standardmodels.synapses.StaticSynapse(weight=0)
    pynn.Projection(external_input,
                    neurons,
                    pynn.OneToOneConnector(),
                    synapse_type=synapse)

We run the experiment for 64 ms, during which we expect a weight change every ms
leading to all image columns being present as weights for this duration one after
the other.

.. code:: ipython3

    pynn.run(64) # ms

Last, the recorded spike-trains are visualized.

.. code:: ipython3

    spikes = neurons.get_data("spikes").segments[0]
    spiketrains = []
    for spiketrain in spikes.spiketrains:
        spiketrains.append(spiketrain.base)

    fig = plt.gcf()
    fig.set_size_inches(4, 4)

    plt.eventplot(spiketrains, color='#990000')
    plt.xlim(0,64)
    plt.ylim(0,63)
    plt.xlabel("time [ms]")
    plt.ylabel("neuron index")
    fig.show()

We see a replicated version of the original image encoded in the time evolution of
the neurons' firing rates.
