    "# Multicompartmental Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous demonstrations we considered point neuron models.\n",
    "However, biological neurons often posses elaborate dendritic trees, which allow them to pre-process the synaptic inputs before they reach the somatic spike initiation zone near the axon initial segment.\n",
    "Taking dendrites as well as their passive and active properties into account can greatly enhance the computational power of neurons [1-3].\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate the features of structured neurons, BrainScaleS-2 offers the possibility to connect several neuron circuits to form multi-compartmental neuron models.\n",
    "The following figure shows a sketch of two neuron circuits and the electronic (**not** synaptic) connections they can establish.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_static/tutorial/multicompartment_connections.png\" style=\"width:500px;\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal switches $ S_{mh} $ and vertical switches $ S_{mv} $ allow to connect neighboring neuron circuits directly – they form a single, isopotential compartment.\n",
    "This can be useful to increase the fan-in of a single compartment as it is now connected to several columns of the synapse array or might be needed to realize certain multi-compartmental models (see the code example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these “membrane connections” each neuron circuit can also connect either directly ($ S_{ms} $) or via a conductance $ R_{ms} $ to a “shared line”.\n",
    "This offers the possibility to connect several compartments via conductances and to form various multi-compartmental neuron models.\n",
    "We will demonstrate the implementation of a multi-compartmental model by the example of a compartment chain and will investigate how excitatory postsynaptic potentials propagate along the chain.\n",
    "The following figure displays a sketch of a chain with four compartments in the top part; in the bottom the hardware implementation is illustrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_static/tutorial/multicompartment_chain_model.png\" style=\"width:500px;\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this demo will motivate why we chose this hardware implementation and will show how this model can be emulated on the BrainScaleS-2 system.\n",
    "You can find more detailed information about the multi-compartmental capabilities, example configurations and experiments with structured neurons in Kaiser et al. 2021 [4]."
